Fixes:
    * Checking nonexistent path in checkBackup() loop should maybe create the path? (but that won't work for nonexistent drives)
    * Comments could use some work, maybe try doxygen standard?

Additions:
    * Catch SIGINT to gracefully stop.
    * Need a better CLI string parser.
    * Running backup should display a progress bar instead of just outputting each operation.
    * More CLI flags need to be added (--force for example).
