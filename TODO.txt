Fixes:
    * globPortable() should respect already matched paths in previousReadPaths_ and ignore paths in ignorePaths_.
    * Output for file errors should be more user friendly.
    * Commands in "main.cpp" should not share state between calls to support CLI behavior.

Additions:
    * Add option to include hidden files with ? and *.
        - It's in the code now, just need config option to set it.
    * Catch SIGINT to gracefully stop.
    * Warn user against recursive backups.
        - Proactive checking may be too complex, so maybe warn by running checkBackup() once done and see if anything pops up (skipped if backup forced).
