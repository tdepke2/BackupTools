Fixes:
    * Comments could use some work, maybe try doxygen standard?

Additions:
    * Option to disable globbing entirely.
    * Option to run backup in "fast" mode, only checks files based on modification date.
        - Might be nice to add a new "set" flag for this too, the CLI args could be used to override this behavior though.
    * CMake build script.
    * Build and test on linux system.
    * Script to run automated backups (or at least instructions on how to set this up with cron job).
