Fixes:
    * globPortable() should respect already matched paths in previousReadPaths_ and ignore paths in ignorePaths_.
    * Output for file errors should be more user friendly.
    * Potential issue with rename optimization:
        - Is renaming a file to itself allowed? It can happen currently.
        - Can files be renamed in an illegal ordering? (a.txt -> b.txt then b.txt -> a.txt)

Additions:
    * Add option to include hidden files with ? and *.
        - It's in the code now, just need config option to set it.
    * Catch SIGINT to gracefully stop.
    * Warn user against recursive backups (detection should probably go in rename optimization code).
