Fixes:
    * globPortable() should respect already matched paths in previousReadPaths_ and ignore paths in ignorePaths_.
    * Use CompareFilename() in more places than just the tree output.

Additions:
    * Add option to include hidden files with ? and *.
    * Catch SIGINT to gracefully stop.
